# Binary Trees
This is a master class with pretty-print output that I created for people who are interested in learning about binary trees and how all the different functionality can behave!

## Method list
* __build_tree__ : Builds a binary tree of size __n__ by drawing random numbers 
between __min_nim__ and __max_num__.  You can also specify an optiona __start__ value to be the stump node.

## Output:
```
